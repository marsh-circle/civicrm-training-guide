# Introduction

## Preperation for trainers

Some general tips

- See if any learners want to do a presentation on how they are using CiviCRM. Having one of these on each day is great.
- Before each session, open up tabs that will be useful.
- Do not try and explain absolutely everything or talk to much about edge cases - there is more than can be covered in two days
- Try not to interrupt exercises, better to share additional insights at the end
- Check how trainees have answered the questions on an individual basis (like a teacher would). You'll likely find a few mistakes and it will give you a good idea about how individual people are getting on. You can start doing this towards the end of the exercise period.

## Day 1 intro

- Icebreakers. Some ideas:
    - Get attendees to interview each other in pairs. Tell them they'll report back to the group on their partner. They should report back on their name, organisation, what they do there, how they are using CiviCRM, what they want out of the training
    - Get everyone to introduce themselves - name, organisation, one thing they are finding challenging, and one thing they are excited about
- Structure of training
    - 5 sessions each day - each is 1 hour long
    - 1 hour of extra time at the end of the day
    - Sessions format is generally
    - presentations and discussion, followed by
    - exercises, followed by recap of the session
    - start with the basics, gets more advanced as we go on.
- Exercises
    - you don't need to do all of them - you can save some for afterwards
    - Please feedback on our exercises as we go. If you think of something, make a note and feed it back to us.
- Questions
    - Feel free to ask questions as we go
    - please also respect everyone's time - we are a diverse group so please don't ask a long series of questions on your very specific use case
- Usernames and passwords, etc.
    - wifi user name and password
    - training site username and password
