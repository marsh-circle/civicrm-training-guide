# Introduction

## Preparation for trainers

Some general tips:
- Before each session, make sure you have useful pages bookmarked or open in tabs
- You might want to start the training with a short icebreaker
- Do not try and explain absolutely everything or talk too much about edge cases
- Encourage people to ask questions as you go
- Try not to interrupt exercises, it's better to share additional insights at the end
- Check how trainees have answered the questions on an individual basis (like a teacher would). You'll likely find a few mistakes and it will give you a good idea about how individual people are getting on. You can start doing this towards the end of the exercise period.
- You might want to end the training with a brief discussion/recap of what has been covered.
