##Session Plan

This session should last 30 minutes.

#### Basic concepts

Give an overview of what the Grants module is used for (making sure learners understand that this is for the management of a grant scheme that is run by your organisation).
The current restrictions should be discussed - grants can only be added manually via the user interface and that there is no connection to the contribute module.

Add a new Grant type and discuss the large range of custom data which might be required (e.g. type of beneficiaries, the outcome of the grant, the beneficiary location, etc).

Explain the grant application process and add a number of grants.

Search for the newly added grants via the Grant Dashboard.

The learners should then do the exercises found in the Grant Handout.

### More useful tools for Grant

Explain that the CiviCRM book contains further detail.
