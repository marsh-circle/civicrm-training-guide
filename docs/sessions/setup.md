##Session Plan

This session should last 60 minutes. Without the exercises, you should be able to complete it in 30 minutes.

Outline the configuration options and allow the learners to experiment.

#### Basic concepts (5 minutes)

Give an overview of the Administration menu console screen and explain the areas which will be covered during the session.

Show the learners the list of available CiviCRM components and how they are enabled.

**Ask the learners to turn off all components** and say that we'll turn them on at the start of each associated session.

Describe to the learners how the changes made affect the user interface.

### The configuration checklist (15 minutes)

Run through the full configuration checklist spending some time on each element (missing out contact types only and payment processors as they are covered in contributions).

Also show the learners how to edit and add entries to the Navigation menu / look at Date formats.

### Exercise 1 (25 minutes)

Then ask the learners to complete Exercise 1 - the learners should be encouraged to explore and if useful questions are asked maybe relay the answer to the whole group.

### Users and Permissions (10 minutes)

Explain how Access Control works to the learners.
As a group exercise talk through a number of different scenarios (invite suggestions from the learners) and discuss the implications of using Access Control.
Being aware that Access Control is used to restrict access to:

- Groups of contacts
- Profiles
- A set of fields
- Events

Look at the Drupal permissions page (mention Drupal Roles as well) and also talk about the Joomla / WordPress permissions.

### Scheduled Jobs (5 minutes)

Make the learners aware of how the scheduled jobs run automatically via server cron jobs.

Examine the scheduled jobs list and explain the purpose of each item.

### More useful tools for Set Up

Explain that the CiviCRM Documentation contains a lot of detail and stress how important it is that any installations are configured correctly.
