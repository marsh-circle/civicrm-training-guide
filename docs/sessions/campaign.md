### What is a campaign?

A campaign is quite simple.  It is like a tag that can be applied all over CiviCRM:

* emails
* contribution pages
* activities
* surveys
* petitions

It has a start date and an optional end date.

A group of contacts can be assigned to the campaign.

Like other CiviCRM objects, it has types and statuses.

Campaigns are useful for grouping different activities under the same banner.

### What is a petition?

Primarily a way to collect signatures online.

Other information can be collected via a contact profile and an activity profile.

### What is a survey?

A way of administering offline data collection. Offline means:

* via a phone banking
* on the go using CiviMobile

Survey also has functionality for working with teams people carrying out the surveys, i.e. ability to reserve respondents to specific individuals.

### Petitions vs. surveys
Petition is not an online survey.  It is a petition. And is optimised as such.

### Online surveys
If you want to collect online data from individuals, you would be better off using webform.
